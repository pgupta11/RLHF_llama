First, upload your reads to assemble, then add your Reads data object to the Narrative and use an Assembly App, such as 'kb_IDBA/run_idba_ud' (Assemble Reads with IDBA-UD - v1.1.3) or 'kb_MaSuRCA/run_masurca_assembler' (MaSuRCA Assembler - v3.2.9), to create an Assembly object. Next, use an Annotation App, such as 'kb_DRAM/run_kb_dram_annotate' (Annotate and Distill Assemblies with DRAM) or 'kb_plant_rast/annotate_plant_transcripts' (Annotate Plant Transcripts with Metabolic Functions), to annotate the Assembly object and explore its structural and functional features.","To annotate a genome in KBase, you can use the Annotation App after assembling your genome using an Assembly App. The Genome importer supports GenBank and GFF formatted files, which can be uploaded to the Staging Area. You can also follow the steps outlined in the Microbial Genome Assembly and Annotation Tutorial to assemble and annotate your genome. The Annotation App in KBase is used for annotating assemblies, genomes, or MAGs with tools like DRAM and DRAM-v, and its properties include active status and categories such as annotation and assembly.",0,1,A,,,3,3,3,3

","To assess the quality of your pair-end reads from an isolate genome in KBase, you can use the 'kb_fastqc/runFastQC' app, also known as 'Assess Read Quality with FastQC - v0.12.1'. This app provides raw read quality control and analysis. You can find more information about this app in the KBase Catalog and Documentation.","To assess the quality of your pair-end reads from an isolate genome in KBase, you can use the FastQC App (app id: 'kb_fastqc/runFastQC'), which provides raw read quality control and analysis. This app can help you evaluate the quality of your reads before proceeding with further analysis. You can run FastQC on your pair-end reads to generate a quality control report.",1,0,B,,,5,5,5,5
